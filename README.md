Atoms_custom_webi
=================

This is my modified webi for the QBO robot that adds Emotion buttons and larger video sizes. To install --- Replace the qbo_webi folder with this one and use "rosmake --rosdep-install qbo_webi" then make all python files executable or change the permissions to this directory.
